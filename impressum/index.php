				<h4>&sect;1 Warning regarding content</h4>
				The free and freely accessible contents of this website were created with the greatest possible care.
				However, the provider of this website does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the free and

				<h4>&sect;2 External links</h4>
				This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are subject to

				checked the external content for possible legal infringements. At that time, no violations of the law
				were apparent. The provider has no influence whatsoever on the current and future design and content
				of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not mean that the provider adopts the content
				behind the reference or link as his own. A constant control of the external links is not reasonable for
				the provider without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, if such violations of the law
				become known, such external links will be deleted immediately.
