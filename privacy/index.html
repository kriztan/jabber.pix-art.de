    <h2>Pix-Art Messenger Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Pix-Art Messenger is an XMPP client which will connect to almost any XMPP server. Pix-Art Messenger will never upload data to the developer automatically. The only execption to this rule is data collected after a crash, but you will be aksed to send the information. This data will be sent via your own XMPP account but never automatically without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>Pix-Art Messenger or its developers don't have control over the data you send through the messenger. However the following data might get uploaded to your XMPP provider:</p>
    <h4>Data uploaded to your XMPP provider</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Messages. This includes text messages, images and any other files your share with the messenger</li>
	<li>Your avatar / profile picture</li>
	<li>Your public keys for the OMEMO encryption</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What does not get uploaded</h4>
    <ul>
	    <li>Your contacts will never be uploaded. Pix-Art Messenger only asks permissions to read your contact to show the profile pictures and names of the corresponding XMPP contacts. Your contacts are never published anywhere.</li>
    </ul>
